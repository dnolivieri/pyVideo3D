# pyVideo3D
An application to explore models for analgyph sound production.

- vstab01.py:  Initial Class module for stabilization. Uses 
optical flow, estimation of rigid body motion 
              
- sblze05.py:  Initial class that uses the phase correlation for 
stablilization.  

- stereo.py:   Class that produces the anaglyph.
